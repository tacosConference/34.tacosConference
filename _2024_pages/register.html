In the unlikely case that you would like to skip some talks during the conference, you may take a stroll at the Rhine or just go to town and enjoy Düsseldorf, which is right on the other side of the river.

						It is of highest priority for the organisation committee to ensure comfort of every participant and lower any stress associated with managing your stay in Bochum. Unfortunately, we're currently unable to fully cover accommodation costs for all travelling participants. Thus, there’s 3 options to choose from:
						<ol>
						<li>
							We are working with local students and especially with other TaCoS participants that live in the Ruhr region, to arrange couchsurfing. The number of people we can accommodate this way is limited and largely depends on the goodwill of the student community, but this will be completely free of charge. Since volunteers will be welcoming strangers at their home, we will try our best to match the needs and expectations of hosts and guests (i.e. allergies, gender, accessibility, etc.). The available places will be allocated based on the waiting list. That is why we kindly ask you to specify, whether you're capable of covering some of the accommodation costs, if no suitable local host can be found.
							<br><br>
							Once all the couchsurfing spots are allocated, the remaining travelling participants will have to pay for their accommodation. These students will receive a partial financial compensation. We can't guarantee a specific amount of money, until we can estimate the number of people in question, as we intend to divide our accommodation budget equally between the students who need a place to stay. Participants making conference contributions (see <a href="https://tacosconference.github.io/faqs">FAQs</a>) will be entitled to higher compensation from an additional pool of money. The compensations will be paid out after the conference. We will do our best to announce the compensation amounts for both groups in a timely manner, so that everybody has an opportunity to figure out their accommodation, by following one of the paths:
						<br><br></li>
						<li>
							We've made an arrangement with the <a href="https://www.hotel-bb.com/de/hotel/bochum-hbf-nord">B&B Hotel</a> at Bochum Hbf for 27 beds in shared rooms for 4 nights from the 21st to the 25th of May (no breakfast included). The average price of 142€ per person is to be paid upon your arrival to Bochum. If you're comfortable with the price, we will reserve a spot for you during the registration on a first-come, first-served basis.
						<br><br></li>
						<li>
							If you're interested in a lower price for accommodation, but you aren't considering staying with a friend or couchsurfing at a local student's place, we encourage you to explore further options like hostels and Airbnbs. Additionally, we have a WhatsApp chat for you to connect with other TaCoS 2025 participants looking for shared accommodation. You will still receive the partial compensation, but your own expenses will be lower - the power is in your hands!
						</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>You can provide all relevant information via the registration form or contact us directly by email, if you have any additional questions.</p>
					<p>We ask for your patience, as we continue working with our sponsors and seeking out ways of making your stay as affordable as possible.</p>
