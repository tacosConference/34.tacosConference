In the unlikely case that you would like to skip some talks during the conference, you may take a stroll at the Rhine or just go to town and enjoy Düsseldorf, which is right on the other side of the river. Beds in the accommodation are reserved on a 'first come first serve' basis depending on the time of your bank transfer of the conference fee. There are 40 beds available.</p>-->

					<p>It is of highest priority for the organisation committee to ensure comfort of every participant and lower any stress associated with managing your stay in Bochum. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we're currently unable to fully cover accommodation costs for all travelling participants. As we continue working with our sponsors and seeking out ways of making your stay as affordable as possible, we highly encourage everybody in need of accommodation to consider their individual situation and communicate their needs via the registration form.</p>
					<p>We can currently offer 3 options:
						<li>We've made an arrangement with the <a href="https://www.hotel-bb.com/de/hotel/bochum-hbf-nord">B&B Hotel</a> at Bochum Hbf for 27 beds in shared rooms averaging at 142€ per person for 4 nights from the 21st to the 25th of May (no breakfast included). This is the best price the organisation committee could get for multiple students at once, and it comes with a convenient location in a lively part of Bochum only 15 minutes away from the conference halls. If you're comfortable with the price, you can pay it in full when you arrive to Bochum, with our discount already included. The available places will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.</li>
						<br>
						<li>For those in need of cheaper options, we are also working with local students and especially with other TaCoS participants that live in the Ruhr region, to arrange couchsurfing. The number of people we can accommodate this way is limited and largely depends on the goodwill of the student community, but this will be completely free of charge. Since volunteers will be welcoming strangers at their home, we will try our best to match the needs and expectations of hosts and guests (i.e. allergies, gender, accessibility, etc.), based on a short introduction you can provide via the registration form. The available places will be allocated based on the waiting list. That is why we kindly ask you to specify, when selecting this option, whether or not you're capable of covering some accommodation costs, if no suitable local host can be found.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Finally, we are open to making individual arrangements with travelling participants who are willing to cover some accommodation costs, but are uncomfortable with the full price of staying at the B&B Hotel, by offering partial financial compensations. The compensation amount will depend on a few factors, including the time of your registration, your mode of participation, disabilities, etc. Until we have this information, along with an estimate of the number of travelling students, who have interest in TaCoS, we can't guarantee a specific amount of money, thus we can't guarantee how low your individual expenses will be, but the power is in your hands!
							<br>
							<br>
							If your individual compensation is calculated as XY €, and you opt for the hotel stay as booked by us, you will have to cover (142 - XY) € yourself. If you're interested in a lower price for accommodation, but you aren't considering staying with a friend or couchsurfing at a local student's place, we highly encourage you to explore further options like hostels and Airbnbs. In this case you'll still be eligible for your pre-calculated compensation of XY €, however, your own expenses will decrease due to the lower price in general. You can experiment with decreasing them even further, if you are willing to share with other TaCoS 2025 participants, i.e. when 3 students are getting an Airbnb together, and each of them is entitled to a partial compensation, the price per person might end up being adjusted in your favor. Similarly, you might be able to save some money by arriving to Bochum early in the morning on 22nd, May or leaving right after the conference content on 24th, May, if you so wish.
						</li>
					</p>
					<p>We ask for your patience as we consider accommodation requests and try to find the best option for each participant.</p>
					<p>You can provide all relevant information via the registration form or contact us directly by email. </p>
