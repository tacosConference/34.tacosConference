In the unlikely case that you would like to skip some talks during the conference, you may take a stroll at the Rhine or just go to town and enjoy Düsseldorf, which is right on the other side of the river. Beds in the accommodation are reserved on a 'first come first serve' basis depending on the time of your bank transfer of the conference fee. There are 40 beds available.--></p>
