- question: This is the first time I'm going to a conference. What do I do?
  answer: While it is perfectly fine to go into student talks without knowledge of the topics whatsoever, if you would like to make the most of your experience, it's best you look at the talks lineup (TBA) and create yourself a timetable so you know when to be at what room to listen to topics that interest you the most. Part of the fun at conferences is being able to directly ask the speakers about their research, having casual discussions and connecting with people from other universities, so bring a pen and paper to note down what you want to remember!

- question: Will I have to hold a talk in order to attend?
  answer: No, you can register just to attend the event without presenting.

- question: I want to present my work, which topics are appropriate?
  answer: You are free to choose the topic based on your interests, projects, and research. There are no strict criteria outside of it being related to computational linguistics or digital humanities with a prominent language focus. You can find a suitable topic by focusing on projects that you're the most proud of completing or that you've learned a lot from, including your bachelors or masters thesis, a term-paper, work done as a student assistent or simply a pet project!
  
- question: I want to present my work, how much time do I have?
  answer: You can select one of three option. A standard presentation should fit into a 30-minute timeslot, with your talk itself taking about 20 miutes, and the final 10 minutes reserved for questions and discussions. Alternatively, if your presentation is more practice-oriented, you can opt for holding a 45-minute workshop. It's up to you to decide on the workshop's structure and question slots. Finally, we will offer one session for lightning talks - short and sweet presentations of about 5 minutes. These are intended as brief introductions to your research interests and projects for networking purposes, so you don't have to go into every detail, but try to highlight the most exciting discoveries and pose questions. 

- question: Do I need to study Computational Linguistics to attend?
  answer: If you are interested in learning more about computatinal linguistics, you are at the right place, no matter what you study.
