  topic: "Juice of life, power current and the Elijah two-act play: Annotation and analysis of metaphors in German sermons"
  description: Stefanie Dipper's research focuses on resources and methods for analyzing historical language data. Among other things, she was involved in the creation of the widely used reference corpora of Middle and Early New High German. In more recent projects, she is working on the syntactic analysis of Middle High German within the framework of Universal Dependencies. She also studies the linguistic properties of metaphors in religious texts.

  topic: Automatic Analysis of Learner Language to Support Learners
  description: Torsten Zesch was the president of GSCL in 2017-2023, and is currently a professor of Computational Linguistics at the Center of Advanced Technology for Assisted Learning and Predictive Analytics. His research interests lie in educational natural language processing, in particular in how teaching and learning processes can be supported by language technology. That is why he develops methods of automatic analysis of textual and multimodal language data, with a focus on robust and explainable models.
