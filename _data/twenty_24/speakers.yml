  description: Stefanie Dipper's research focuses on resources and methods for analyzing historical language data. Among other things, she was involved in the creation of the widely used reference corpora of Middle and Early New High German. In more recent projects, she is working on the syntactic analysis of Middle High German within the framework of Universal Dependencies. She also studies the linguistic properties of metaphors in religious texts.
