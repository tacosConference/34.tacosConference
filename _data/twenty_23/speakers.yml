  topic: Semantic Roles for Semantic Parsing - Lessons Learned and Future Directions
  description: In this talk I report on efforts to annotate a parallel Role and Reference Grammar treebank (RRGparbank) with semantic roles for verbs. I discuss the annotation scheme developed, the annotation process, and semantic parsing results. Finally, I highlight some problems with existing annotation schemes based on VerbNet, PropBank, FrameNet, and VerbAtlas, and sketch a new scheme that solves some of these problems.

  topic: Computational models in Parkinson's Disease research
  description: Speech can be used as a non-invasive biomarker to capture fine changes in speech patterns in normal populations and individuals diagnosed with neuromotor disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this talk, I will demonstrate how computational models that are linguistically-informed can quantify acoustic and syntactic variations in PD patients.
